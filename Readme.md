# Hackathon Dauphine 28 & 29 February 2020

### Description
I had the chance to participate to a hackathon with my school, ENSAE ParisTech, in collaboration with Dauphine (PSL University).
The competition was about predicting if the volatility was over-estimated by the market or not, so that we can adjust our strategy.

### Data Analysis
As all the data was very nicely prepared for the competition we didn't have any cleaning to do, and we had time to perform a deep analysis of the data :
We added some features like the Super Sector, the Sharpe, and normalized some of the features by sector or region.

### Model
For the model, we chose a Balanced Random Forest, after having tried a XGBoost, which overfitted a lot.

### Results
With my teammates from my master (MSDS, Master Spécialisé en Data Science), we ended-up winning the competition, and were awarded a 2000€ prize.
